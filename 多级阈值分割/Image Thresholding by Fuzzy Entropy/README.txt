This is a code for GLOBAL MULTI-LEVEL THRESHOLDING OF IMAGES. The package contains the following files:

Demo.m                   : A demo file, which can be run directly to view a sample result.
thresholdImage.m         : The function that thresholds a single channel of the image
differentialEvolution.m  : The function that computes the optimal threshold vectors
fuzzyEntropy.m           : The file computes the shannon entropy for of the image for a particular threshold
55067.jpg                : A color image taken from Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark (BSDS)
